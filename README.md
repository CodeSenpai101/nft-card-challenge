## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned about the hover function in CSS by doing this challenge. 

### Continued development

My main focus is to keep building my knowledge, by building these real world projects. Also just to get better at programming as a whole.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me just to see some syntax I didn't remember.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.example.com) - This example actually helped find the hover effect for the image I needed.
